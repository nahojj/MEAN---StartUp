MEAN APP StartUp
(MongoDB - ExpressJS - AngularJS - NodeJS WITH EJS)
==========

This is a beginning for those who want to make a MEAN app from scratch. Here you get the absolute essentials to begin with. In the folder 'Google', you have authentication with Google.

Keep in mind that this is a beginning for those who want to build a MEAN app from the beginning and the login-system should not be used in an actual production.

### Install:
```
npm install package.json
```
### Usage:

Run `node auth_server.js` in the terminal to start.
Go to `localhost:3000/login` to view.



A database called 'sessions' will automatically be created in your system. You can modify and configure this in `auth_server.js` file.

###This is what you get:

```
- User Registration (/signup)
- Login (/login)
- Update User Infomation (/user/update)
- Delete User Account (/user/delete)

```
